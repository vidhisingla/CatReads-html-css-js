                <h4>How reading changes your brain, according to neuroscience</h4>
                <p>We all know that reading improves our vocabulary, widens our perspective, introduces us to new ideas and boost confidence. It is a habit that everyone must adopt  sooner and continue with throughout life. Ti is considered the key to success. As per neuroscience, it not only fills our brain with information but also makes it work better. Obsessive reading can rewrite the way brain thinks and process things in a better way....</p>

                <h4>Reading fiction and reading minds: the role of simulation in the default network</h4>
                <p>Readers of fiction can transcend the here-and-now to experience worlds, people and mental states that differ vastly from their local reality. The consequences of reading, however, extend far beyond the subjective experience of any one individual. Researchers from fields as diverse as evolutionary psychology, literary studies and anthropology have independently credited literacy as a possible explanation for such fundamental societal shifts as the decline in human violence over the past few centuries, the development of desire-based over rule-based social interactions, and the advent of ‘modern subjectivity’ (Lukacs, 1920; Watt, 1957; Ong, 1982; McKeon, 1987; Habermas, 1991; Pinker, 2011). Such large-scale societal impacts may nevertheless begin with small behavioral changes in individual readers, who demonstrate greater civic engagement...</p>

                <h4>Short- and Long-Term Effects of a Novel on Connectivity in the Brain</h4>
                <p>Most people can identify books that have made great impressions on them and, subjectively, changed the way they think. Some can even point to a book that has changed their life. Stephen King, for example, said that Lord of the Flies changed his life, “because it is both a story with a message and because it is a great tale of adventure.” Joyce Carol Oates pointed to Alice in Wonderland as “the book that most influenced her imaginative life.” It seems plausible that if something as simple as a book can leave the impression that one's life has been changed, then perhaps it is powerful enough to cause changes in brain function and structure. Here, we test this possibility by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to track changes in resting-state brain activity on a daily basis over a period of 3 weeks, during which individuals read a complete novel.</p>

                <h4>The Case for Reading Fiction</h4>
                <p>Some of the most valuable skills that managers look for in employees are often difficult to define, let alone evaluate or quantify: self-discipline, self-awareness, creative problem-solving, empathy, learning agility, adaptiveness, flexibility, positivity, rational judgment, generosity, and kindness, among others. How can you tell if your future employees have these skills? And if your current team is lacking them, how do you teach them? Recent research in neuroscience suggests that you might look to the library for solutions; reading literary fiction helps people develop empathy, theory of mind, and critical thinking.</p>

                <h4>Can Reading Make You Happier?</h4>
                <p>Several years ago, I was given as a gift a remote session with a bibliotherapist at the London headquarters of the School of Life, which offers innovative courses to help people deal with the daily emotional challenges of existence. I have to admit that at first I didn’t really like the idea of being given a reading “prescription.” I’ve generally preferred to mimic Virginia Woolf’s passionate commitment to serendipity in my personal reading discoveries, delighting not only in the books themselves but in the randomly meaningful nature of how I came upon them (on the bus after a breakup, in a backpackers’ hostel in Damascus, or in the dark library stacks at graduate school, while browsing instead of studying). I’ve long been wary of the peculiar evangelism of certain readers: You must read this, they say, thrusting a book into your hands with a beatific gleam in their eyes, with no allowance for the fact that books...</p>
